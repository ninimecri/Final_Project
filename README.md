Made by Nicole Mej√≠a.

Telecommunications operator Interconnect would like to be able to predict its customer churn rate. If a customer is found planning to leave, they will be offered promotional codes and special plan options. Interconnect's marketing team has collected some of its customers' personal data, including information about their plans and contracts.
